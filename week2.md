This week was focused on looking over the data and cleaning it. In the beginning, I was haivng trouble understanding the assignment and how to start as well as what is expected. I started to get more confortable asking my mentors for help which made the project go by quickly. Although I am still stuck on a few of the fundamentals of regex, python, and other coding functions, I was continously being encouraged to take my time and be patient with myself while learning and continuing the project. Throughout the week I learned the importance of research, the correlations of research and writing, along with structuring the paper to have a great paper. Although I personally already had previous knowledge of those, it was nice to get that refreshers as well as learning a few more points throughout the entire presentation. Following after that, in the labs, we were reinforced about or roles and how the final product should be presented. 

I learned how to read code fully and understand how to write my own function for the data. I learned that coding can be done in multiple different ways and most of the time I would over complicate things when the desired function only required a few codes. Through my own research I looked through hugging face models to pick the most desired model to fit the projects need and outcome. Called Go-emotion. My next step will be to train the data and the model by reviewing the data and labeling the data by the emotions that we as the reader feel from it. This portion of the project will be the longest portion of the project however, I believe that since it will be someting that is split amongst the group, I think that it would be something that could be finished quickly. 

My group also met with the lead mentor and talked baout any complications that we may oversee duirng the course of the project, our roles for the project and what is our project trying to solve or improve. The meeting was quite insightful and laid a stronger foundation for what is the expected outcome. What I personally liked about the meeting was that it was two other projects in the room also being apart of the meeting, listening, and answering questions about their projects as well.

One thing that I think would be ore beneficial for the project during the first week would be a longer duration of the bootcamp classes as well as more smaller groups. 

I look forward to next week because I feel like I potentially slowed down the process and put us behind because I was not sure how to code or do what was neccesary for my role. However, now that I think I have caught up enough to be able to move on to the next step.
