 During my first week here at CEAMLS, I was introduced to many new skills to further my skills in compter sciences such as coding, foundatamentals in PYTHON, introducing many computer software programs and etc. This week I have accomplished finsihing a few of the assignments in Google CoLab. Activities such as builing and testing different machine learning models and learning the difference between the supervised and unsupervised testing. Also, learning SciKit, Pandas, and NumPy as well as learniing the importance, the functions and the properties that are associated with them. One thing that I found very helpful was the crash course on the foundation and introduction of python. Python is a kind of coding language that is very common amongst the world when coding.

Some of the finding that I found throughout the week was the ability to print strings, solve mathmatical equations, run data allgorithims and being able to split, rearrange, read and manipulate data makin git easier to interpret data for statistical projects.

Issues and complications I had personally was just having to be able to catch up and undertstand what is going on As somone that is not a technology major alot of the langauge, termanology and codes used were a completely foreign language to me. Alot of the time the speakers would just tell us the information and explain its importance but when it is time for coding and I come acros an issue, they just fix the code and unable to explain what they did to fix it and how I can replicate it for future use which was very frustrating.

Great people, great activities, I enjoyed this week!
